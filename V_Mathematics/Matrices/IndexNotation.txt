- The first index indicates the row number, listed from top to bottom
- The second index indicates the column number, listed from right to left
- Thus we move from the top right, to the bottom left similar to images
- Unlike images, we itterate column first, rather than row first.


- From my understanding most sources use colomum vectors, and column major ordering
    - this means that transformations are computed as A*x where A is an
	  m*m matrix and x is a m*1 column vector.
	- Two apply apply second transformation after a first transformation you would
	  caluculate A'= B * A using pre-multiplication.
	- This copies the convention of funcitonal composition, seeing a matrix as a funciton
	  of vectors (f.g)(x) = f(g(x)). In this case, g is applied first, then f.
	  Inother words A(B(x)) implies B * A when A and B are matricies.


- Vectors should probably be considered column vectors by default, except in
  special cases, where we should indicate we are using the vector transpose.


- The following are synomonous:
      Height = Number of Rows = Column Length
	  Width = Number of Columns = Row Length

- In wolfram alpha the input {{a,b},{c,d}} results in the following matrix
    | a b |
	| c d | 



  M[i, j] //i = row, j = col

  //loops over the rows
  for (int i = 0; i < num_rows; i++) //height
  {
	  //loops over each value in the rows
      for (int j = 0; j < num_cols; j++) //width
	  {
	      M[i, j] //do something
	  }
  }

  //loops over the rows
  foreach (Vector row in M)
  {
      //loops over each value in the rows
	  foreach (double cell in row)
	  {
	      //do something
	  }
  }
