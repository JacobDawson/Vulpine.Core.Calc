# Vulpine Core Library: Numerical Methods

This project is part of the Vulpine Core Library, a repository of code that I 
use for all my personal projects. The projects that comprise this library are 
under constant development, and are subject to change at any time. I cannot 
in good faith recommend this library for use in production code. There are 
better, more stable libraries out there that do the same thing. You may, however, 
find it useful for personal projects and educational purposes. The entire library 
is documented in source, so there shouldn't be any confusion about what something 
dose. I have begun to release parts of this library as open source, in the hope 
that someone will find it useful.

This part of the Vulpine Core Library deals with numerical methods. It contains a
collection of algorithms and math-based data structures that I have found useful.
It contains classes for polynomials, matrices, linear regression, optimization, 
and many other fields. Together with the data structures library, it forms a
corner-stone of the entire Vulpine Core Library.
