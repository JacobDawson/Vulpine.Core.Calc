# Vulpine Core Library: Numerical Methods

https://www.jacobs-den.org/projects/core-library/

The Vulpine Core Library is a collection of software libraries (assemblies) written in the C# programing language. It is my personal repository of code, in that I am the sole developer. However, I have opened it up to the public, under the Apache License 2.0, with the hope that it would be of some benefit. It serves as the backbone of most of my homegrown video games and applications. The fractals and other computer generated art I have on display were created using the code from this library.

The library itself is continuously evolving, as I am constantly adding to it, updating it whenever I find something that tickles my fancy. I have big plans for stuff that I want to include in the library, and it is far from completion. I doubt it will ever be complete. Due to the dynamic nature of the library, I cannot guarantee backwards compatibility, so expect to have to re-factor your code if you use any of my APIs. Of course you are free to rewrite my code in your own style, whatever fits your needs.

This part of the Vulpine Core Library deals with numerical methods. It contains a collection of algorithms and math-based data structures that I have found useful. It contains classes for polynomials, matrices, linear regression, optimization, and many other fields. Together with the data structures library, it forms a corner-stone of the entire Vulpine Core Library.

All documentation for the library is included in the code itself. Every public method and class is heavily commented, providing intellisense for things like parameter use and expected output. I hope it is clear-cut what each method dose, and its intended use, from the documentation I have provided. If not, at least I tried my best. I hope that you will find my code useful, and intuitive, and perhaps maybe even learn something from it.
